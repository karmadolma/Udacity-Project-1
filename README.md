## Data Analytics Project: Investigating a Movie Dataset

This was the first project I completed as part of my Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree.

The movie dataset was provided by Udacity and is also publicly available in kaggle. The data includes information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. The data can be accessed from this link [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv&sa=D&ust=1605197347716000&usg=AOvVaw1SoCpfUCeHn5oyvjgbJPP-).


### Preview

The whole analysis was driven by the following three questions:

```markdown

- Which genres of the movies are the most popular from year to year?
- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
- Which movies have made the most money?

```
