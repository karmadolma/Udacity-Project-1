## Data Analytics Project: Investigating a Movie Dataset

This was the first project I completed as part of my Udacity Data Analytics Nanodegree.

The movie dataset was provided by Udacity and is also publicly available in kaggle. The data includes information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue. The data can be accessed from this link [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv&sa=D&ust=1605197347716000&usg=AOvVaw1SoCpfUCeHn5oyvjgbJPP-).

### Variables in the dataset

```markdown

1. id
2. imdb_id
3. popularity
4. budget
5. revenue
6. original_title
7. cast
8. homepage
9. director
10. tagline
11. keywords
12. overview
13. runtime
14. genres

16. release_date
17. vote_count
18. vote_average
19. release_year

```

### Objective

The whole analysis was driven by the following three questions:

```markdown

- Which genres of the movies are the most popular from year to year?
- What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
- Which movies have made the most money?

```
